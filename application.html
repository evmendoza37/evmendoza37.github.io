  <h2> Naturalization || Application Process</h2>
  <h4>Naturalization is the way that a person not born in the United States voluntarily becomes a U.S. citizen </h4>
</div>
  <h3>General Eligibility Requirements:</h3>
  <h4>‣Before applying, it is good to know if you meet all of the requirements ahead of time.</h4>
    <h5>‣Be at least 18 years old at the time you file for an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/n-400"> Application for Naturalization</a>.
        ‣Be a permanent resident (have a “Green Card”) for at least 5 years.
        ‣Demonstrate continuous residence in the United States for at least 5 years immediately before the date you file Form N-400.
        ‣Show that you have been physically present in the United States for at least 30 months out of the 5 years immediately before the date you file Form N-400.
        ‣Show that you have lived for at least 3 months in the state or USCIS district where you apply. Students may apply for naturalization either where they go to school or where their family lives (if they are still financially dependent on their parents).
        ‣Be a person of good moral character.
        ‣Demonstrate an attachment to the principles and ideals of the U.S. Constitution.

<!--Disadvantages of being a citizen starts-->
 <h3>Disadvantages: </h3>
  <h4>Becoming a US citizen is beneficial but the process and responsibilites behind it are not always dandy. Here is key negative things about becoming a naturalized US citizen.</h4>
  <h4>‣Taxes</h4>
   <h5>All citizens are required to pay taxes for income earned anywhere in the world. So if you plan to work outside the US, make sure you contact a tax expert to see how becoming a citizen might affect your income.  <h5>
   <h5>It is often hard to escape your tax liability to the US goverment, even if you give up your citizenship. Whereas, those with a green card don't have to worry about filing tax returns once they give up their green card.  <h5>

 <h4>‣Jury</h4>
   <h5> To most, jury duty is a burden, where others feel like it is their libery and right to have the ability to do so. If jury duty is a advantage or disadvantage that is up for you to decide.</h5>
 <h4>‣Losing Another Country's Citizenship</h4>
    <h5>Depending on the country you currently have citizenship, becoming a 'US' citizen can change or manipulate the privileges of being in your home country. </h5>
